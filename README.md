# C++ Extrenal Pattern Scanning
This repository is dedicated to a C++ based implementation of Pattern Scanning, often used for creating external hacks in various applications. Let's discuss the basics of these concepts below.

# What is Pattern Scanning?
Pattern scanning, also known as signature scanning, is a technique used to find or 'scan' a sequence of bytes that forms a certain 'pattern' within a process's memory. This technique is widely used in software engineering, game hacking, reverse engineering and more. The sequence of bytes, or 'signature', can refer to anything from a hard-coded string, a set of instructions, or a piece of data within a program.

# What is an External Hack?
An external hack is a type of software that influences another software or game externally, i.e., it does not inject or modify the code of the target process directly. Instead, it reads and writes the memory of another process. This is often used in video game cheating tools, to manipulate the state of a game without being detected by anti-cheat systems.

# Project Overview
This project provides a practical example of a C++ pattern scanning implementation that can be used for creating external hacks. The code has been designed to be simple, efficient, and easily understandable.
My first github project, my mum would be so proud.

# Development History
This was originally created for a Youtube tutorial for Guided Hacking

Our original [internal pattern scanning tutorial](https://guidedhacking.com/threads/c-signature-scan-pattern-scanning-tutorial.3981/) was made by Fleep and but it's pretty poorly made.

So we decided to make an updated video tutorial showing [external pattern scanning](https://guidedhacking.com/threads/c-external-signature-scanning-pattern-scanning-tutorial.8255/) as well.

There ended up being a few bugs in the source code so I posted this repo to GitHub so it's easier for people to get the updated version.

The code is for Part 2 of this Youtube Tutorial and contains code intended for teaching beginners.
I also include code to showcase tips and tricks I have to share that may not relate to the core purpose of this project.
